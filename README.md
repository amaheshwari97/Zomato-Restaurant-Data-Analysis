# Zomato-Restaurant-Data-Analysis
The basic idea behind this project was to analyze each restaurant's performance on Zomato. The dataset from Kaggle provided numerous characteristics for judging a restaurant based on ratings, votes, location, cuisines, and so on, through which we were able to effectively perform Exploratory Data Analysis in R Studio and transform all of the business questions into findings.

##Conclusion
By this Project we got the basic understanding of how much importance a data analytics can play into multiple decision making process like, Where to open a new restaurant?, What is speciality of this restauarnt?, How much a meal can cost me?, etc.
This project covers the entire process, including data wrangling, cleaning, and EDA.
Along with the fundamental approach, we learned how to use libraries such as ggplot, maps, mapdata, sf, gridextra, and others.
We may deduce from this project that there are "n" viable business solutions that can be obtained by employing data analytics.
